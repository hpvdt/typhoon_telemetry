# Hardware Folder

Folder for each of the boards designed for a given project, even if there is only one board for a given project. Once a board is put into manufacture any revisions should go into a new folder/project so that the design data for all boards is easily accessible for troubleshooting without needing to dig through revision history.

The `.gitignore` file is configured for KiCad projects (as of 2023-12-06).
